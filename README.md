The game plays full screen only (no mobile devices) 
The game has a "Heaven" room and a "Hell" room. These are assigned randomly 
These two rooms are locked and the keys are in other rooms (assigned randomly also) 
Each time you play the game, the rooms allocated will be different 
If you try to enter a "locked room" (i.e. heaven or hell), it will not allow you in
Once you have the key (it will tell you), the key is automatically placed in your 'pocket'
Now when you go to the locked room that the key opens, you will be allowed entry 
If it is the heaven room - you win if it is the hell room - you will lose. 
The game ends at that point and the navigation bars disappear to indicate the game has ended
A message is displayed "Game Over" You need to reload to restart the game
