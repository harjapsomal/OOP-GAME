    The rooms are shown visually on a 3x3 layout. As you move around (using the
    navigation buttons), the current room is highlighted.<br />
    One room is Heaven, another is Hell. Both are locked, and the keys are in
    other rooms. If you find the room containing the key, you are informed that
    you have the key. The key is placed in your pocket. Once you try to enter a
    locked room, it now opens since you have the key in your possession. You WIN
    the game by arriving in heaven. You LOSE the game by falling into hell.
    Every time you play, the heaven/hell rooms are RANDOMLY assigned. The game
    is designed to be played on a laptop only, not mobile devices. Good luck.
